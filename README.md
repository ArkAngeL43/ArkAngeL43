# whoami

I am a web developer, programmer, ex game cheat developer, and ethical hacker. i am currently working from home with a team of a few people, in line with the parrot CTF's development team, i have a past of attempting to program in many languages most of which have failed, and come from a background in hacking which can be considered a begginers waste of time, however i am back on track! currently learning binary exploitation, image injection, porting exploits in new languages, along side tackling my skill in languages like Ruby, Crystal, Perl, and Go. my current level of experitise in hacking is networking, and some web exploitation, when i am done learning more about web exploitation, finishing my skill in binary and image injection, i will continue onto the automotive pentesting road and developing tools for that as well :D 


# about the groups i work with

I currently work with my own security team named Scare_Security, where our goal is to push people into security and get people to understand the true mass dangers of hacking, where people will care enough to secure thier data and keep their clients secure with ever bit of security they can :D, i also am apart of the parrot CTF's platform which is a CTF platform for hackers, where the labs are OWASP, CRTP & OSCP Based Training Labs. our goal is to teahc general security and to take champion as the nect generation CTF platform not only where people can have fun but also learn.
